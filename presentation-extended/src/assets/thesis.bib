  abstract  = {Reproducible Builds (R-B) guarantee that rebuilding a software package from source leads to bitwise identical artifacts. R-B is a promising approach to increase the integrity of the software supply chain, when installing open source software built by third parties. Unfortunately, despite success stories like high build reproducibility levels in Debian packages, uncertainty remains among field experts on the scalability of R-B to very large package repositories. In this work, we perform the first large-scale study of bitwise reproducibility, in the context of the Nix functional package manager, rebuilding 709816 packages from historical snapshots of the nixpkgs repository, the largest cross-ecosystem open source software distribution, sampled in the period 2017-2023. We obtain very high bitwise reproducibility rates, between 69 and $91 \%$ with an upward trend, and even higher rebuildability rates, over $99 \%$. We investigate unreproducibility causes, showing that about $15 \%$ of failures are due to embedded build dates. We release a novel dataset with all build statuses, logs, as well as full “diffoscopes”: recursive diffs of where unreproducible build artifacts differ.},

This principle of reusability however makes it harder to reproduce projects' build environments, even though reproducibility of build environments is essential for collaboration, maintenance and component lifetime. In this work, we argue that functional package managers provide the tooling to make build environments reproducible in space and time, and we produce a preliminary evaluation to justify this claim. Using historical data, we show that we are able to reproduce build environments of about 7 million Nix packages, and to rebuild 99.94\% of the 14 thousand packages from a 6-year-old Nixpkgs revision.},
